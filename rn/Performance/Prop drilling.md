# 🧬 React Prop Drilling: What It Is, Problems, and Solutions

**Prop Drilling** is the process of passing data from a top-level component down to deeply nested components **through intermediate components** that don’t necessarily need the data.

---

## 📌 What Is Prop Drilling?

It happens when:
- A component needs data from an ancestor
- That data must be passed down through several layers of components, even if intermediate components don’t use it

---

## 🧪 Example of Prop Drilling

```jsx
function App() {
  const user = { name: "Kishan" };
  return <Parent user={user} />;
}

function Parent({ user }) {
  return <Child user={user} />;
}

function Child({ user }) {
  return <GrandChild user={user} />;
}

function GrandChild({ user }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {user.name}</h1>;
}
```

Here, `user` is passed through `Parent` and `Child` just to reach `GrandChild`.

## ⚠️ Problems with Prop Drilling

| Problem | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🔄 Tight coupling | Intermediate components depend on props they don’t use |
| 📉 Readability drops | Code becomes harder to follow |
| 🔧 Maintenance headache | Small changes in data needs affect multiple components |
| 🧱 Inflexible | Hard to reuse components independently |

---

## ✅ How to Avoid Prop Drilling

### 1. **React Context API**

```jsx
const UserContext = createContext();

function App() {
  const user = { name: "Kishan" };

  return (
    <UserContext.Provider value={user}>
      <Parent />
    </UserContext.Provider>
  );
}

function GrandChild() {
  const user = useContext(UserContext);
  return <h1>Hello, {user.name}</h1>;
}
```

➡️ Now `GrandChild` can access `user` **directly** without props.

---

### 2. **State Management Libraries**

- Libraries like **Redux**, **Zustand**, or **Recoil** provide global state management
- Prevent prop drilling across deeply nested trees

---

### 3. **Component Composition / Hooks**

- Instead of passing data, consider **wrapping components** or extracting reusable logic with **custom hooks**

---

## 🧠 Best Practices

| ✅ Do | ❌ Don’t |
|------|----------|
| Use Context for shared/global data | Pass data through many intermediate components |
| Use state managers for large apps | Overuse props for deeply nested values |
| Keep components loosely coupled | Hardcode prop chains everywhere |

---

## 🧠 When Is Prop Drilling Acceptable?

- Small component trees
- Short chains (1–2 levels)
- Data used only in a few places
