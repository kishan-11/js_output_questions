# üîë Understanding Keys and Key Extractors in React

Keys help React identify which items in a list have changed, been added, or removed. This improves performance and stability during rendering and reconciliation.

---

## üìå Why Are Keys Important?

React uses a **diffing algorithm** (reconciliation) to compare the previous and current virtual DOM.  
Keys let React:
- Track items between renders
- Reuse DOM nodes
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders

---

## üß™ Example Without Keys

```jsx
const items = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
return items.map(item => <li>{item}</li>);
```

- ‚ùå No keys: React can‚Äôt uniquely identify elements
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May cause incorrect updates

---

## ‚úÖ Example With Keys

```jsx
const items = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
return items.map(item => <li key={item}>{item}</li>);
```

- ‚úÖ React now knows which element corresponds to what

---

## üîÅ Reconciliation with and without Keys

Change from:
```jsx
['a', 'b', 'c']
```
to:
```jsx
['a', 'x', 'c']
```

### Without Keys:
- Compares by position ‚Üí `b` becomes `x`
- Replaces DOM node for index 1

### With Keys:
- Compares by key ‚Üí `b` ‚â† `x`, only updates that one item

---

## üì± `keyExtractor` in FlatList (React Native)

```tsx
<FlatList
  data={users}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <UserCard user={item} />}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id.toString()}
/>
```

- Required for stable rendering
- Prevents layout and performance bugs
- Essential for virtualization logic

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What Happens With Duplicate Keys?

### ‚ùå Incorrect DOM Updates
React:
- May reuse or skip elements improperly
- Renders wrong content in wrong place

### üß™ Example

```jsx
const items = [{ id: 1, name: "A" }, { id: 1, name: "B" }];
items.map(item => <div key={item.id}>{item.name}</div>);
```

- Both have `key="1"` ‚Üí React gets confused

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Results of Duplicate Keys

| Issue                        | Description                            |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| DOM mismatch                | Incorrect elements reused              |
| UI flicker                  | Elements disappear or overlap          |
| Performance drops           | More DOM diffing required              |
| Console warnings            | React logs: "Encountered two children with the same key" |

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices for Keys

| Do                                | Don‚Äôt                                 |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Use unique, stable keys like `id` | Use array `index` for dynamic lists   |
| Use `keyExtractor` in FlatList    | Omit `key` in `map()` calls            |
| Avoid duplicate or changing keys  | Use random strings or timestamps       |

---

## üß† Summary

- Keys are vital for reconciliation and performance
- They must be **unique** and **stable**
- Improper use (or duplication) leads to visual and logic bugs
- In FlatList, use `keyExtractor` for proper virtualization
