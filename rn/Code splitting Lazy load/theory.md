# üöÄ React Code Splitting & Lazy Loading

**Code splitting** is a performance optimization technique that breaks large JavaScript bundles into smaller chunks.  
React supports **lazy loading** via `React.lazy()` and `Suspense` to defer loading parts of the UI until needed.

---

## üìå What Is Code Splitting?

> Code splitting allows you to **load only the code you need** for the current view, instead of one large bundle for the whole app.

It improves:
- Initial load time
- Perceived performance
- Bandwidth efficiency

## üß† React.lazy

### üîπ Syntax

```jsx
const MyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./MyComponent'));
```

- Dynamically imports the module when it‚Äôs needed
- Must be rendered within a `<React.Suspense>` boundary

---

## üéØ Suspense

### üîπ Usage

```jsx
import React, { Suspense } from 'react';

const Settings = React.lazy(() => import('./Settings'));

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <Settings />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

- `fallback` is rendered while the component is loading

## üì¶ Real-World Use Cases

| Scenario | Use Case |
|----------|----------|
| Large apps | Break pages/components into async chunks |
| Route-based splitting | Lazy load per route (React Router) |
| Feature flags | Conditionally load components |
| Dashboard widgets | Load panels on scroll or click |

---

## üß© Route-Based Code Splitting (React Router v6+)

```jsx
import { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';
import { Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

const Home = lazy(() => import('./Home'));
const About = lazy(() => import('./About'));

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading page...</p>}>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="about" element={<About />} />
      </Routes>
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

## üõ† Tips and Gotchas

| Tip | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| Use meaningful fallback | Avoid blank UI |
| Avoid excessive lazy loading | Too much fragmentation hurts UX |
| Combine with bundlers like Webpack | Use `webpackChunkName` for named chunks |
| Lazy load only after app is interactive | Use interaction or scroll triggers if needed |

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- Can‚Äôt lazy-load **named exports** (only default)
- Not usable with non-React code directly (wrap in components)
- Suspense for data fetching requires experimental features (React 18+)

---

## üß† Best Practices

- Lazy load routes and heavy feature components
- Use suspense boundaries wisely (e.g., per page or layout)
- Avoid lazy loading above-the-fold content for better UX
- Use performance tools to measure improvements
