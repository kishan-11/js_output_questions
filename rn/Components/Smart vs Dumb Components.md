# 🧠 Smart vs Dumb Component Pattern in React

The **Smart/Dumb Component Pattern** (also called **Container/Presentational Pattern**) is a way to organize components by **separating logic from UI**.

---

## 📌 Definitions

### 🧠 Smart Components
- Also known as **containers**
- Handle **data fetching**, **state**, **business logic**
- Pass data and callbacks to dumb components
- Often connect to Redux, Context, APIs

### 🎨 Dumb Components
- Also known as **presentational** components
- Focus on **how things look**
- Stateless or only manage local UI state
- Receive everything via **props**

---

## 🧪 Example

### 🎨 Dumb (Presentational) Component

```jsx
function Profile({ name, onLogout }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{name}</h2>
      <button onClick={onLogout}>Logout</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 🧠 Smart (Container) Component

```jsx
function ProfileContainer() {
  const user = useContext(UserContext);
  
  const logout = () => {
    authService.logout();
  };

  return <Profile name={user.name} onLogout={logout} />;
}
```

## 🎯 Why Use Smart/Dumb Pattern?

| Benefit               | Description                                |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Reusability            | Dumb components are more reusable          |
| Testability            | Easier to test UI and logic independently  |
| Maintainability        | Cleanly separates business logic from UI   |
| Scalability            | Easier to manage in large applications     |

## ⚖️ Comparison Table

| Feature                | Smart Component       | Dumb Component             |
|------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|
| Manages state?         | ✅ Yes                | ❌ No                      |
| Connects to Redux/API? | ✅ Often              | ❌ No                      |
| Logic-heavy?           | ✅ Yes                | ❌ Minimal logic           |
| Aware of data source?  | ✅ Yes                | ❌ No                      |
| Reusable?              | ❌ Rarely             | ✅ Frequently              |

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

| Mistake | Why it’s bad | Fix |
|--------|---------------|-----|
| Mixing logic in dumb components | Breaks separation of concerns | Move logic to smart component |
| Making every component “smart” | Reduces reusability and increases complexity | Favor dumb components where possible |
| Passing too many props | Cluttered and hard to track | Use prop groups or composition |

---

## 🧠 Best Practices

- Use smart components to fetch and manage data
- Use dumb components to render UI based on props
- Follow naming: `ProfileContainer`, `ProfileView`, etc.
- Compose dumb components into smart ones for complex UIs
